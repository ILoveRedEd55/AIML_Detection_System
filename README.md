Steps To Run The System:

First:
Download the zip and extract the files to wherever directory you want to put this system.


Second:
Before running the system, you need to download the required files to run the system. Below is the GDrive link for the said files. Note that the zipped file size is 2.5GB and is around 6.5GB when extracted.


Link for the files:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dU9MCKk2lUZJIwBx75T0iuXWUt1iMM-M?usp=sharing


After downloading the files in the GDrive, locate the 'lib' directory inside the directory and extract the files inside.


Third:
Navigate to the 'src' directory and and run 'Main.py'. I highly recommend using VS Code when running this file. After opening the file using VS Code, run the system.
